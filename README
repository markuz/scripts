**** Hello! ****

This are scripts that I wrote on my day to day, most of them
to do repetitive tasks that I hate to do.

Feel free to navigate, examine, and improve if you want, and 
let me know about the changes to integrate here! :-).

Btw.. the code here (unles it explicitly says something else) is released under 
the GNU/GPL v. 2, read the file COPYING for that
